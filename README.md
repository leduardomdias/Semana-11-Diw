# To-Do List Application

A sleek and user-friendly to-do list application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Task data is stored in the browser’s local storage, so tasks persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a single click.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed, and they’ll be visually updated.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit any task directly in the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are stored in `localStorage`, ensuring they remain between sessions.
